# vue-boilerplate
Very Simple Boilerplate for Vue
## Contents
At the moment all this comes with is a basic js file for getting data from a JSON source - saving it to a variable and being able to output this in an HTML file. It's not much but I find this is where a lot of ideas start, so having a boilerplate I can quickly pull in makes getting up and running easier.
## Future
I'll update this as and when I see a need - am I doing something consistently as a first step after pulling in the new project? Then it should probably be in the boilerplate. I will also begin to integrate with a build and deployment process.
